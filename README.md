# Docker images for student workshops

These docker images contain the necessary tools to complete the [cloud workshops](https://github.com/pgaxatte/cloud-workshops/).

Two images are available:
- the terminal only image in the `ssh` directory
- the web IDE image based on [theia](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/) in the `theia`
    directory

## Terminal only

```shell
make ssh
```

## Web IDE

```shell
make theia
```
